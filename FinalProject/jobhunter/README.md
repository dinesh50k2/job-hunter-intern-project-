# **JobHunter: Spring Boot + React**

**JobHunter** is a full-stack web application designed as a job portal, offering users the ability to search for jobs, apply to them, and manage their profiles. The platform is divided into two main parts: a **React-based frontend** for the user interface and a **Spring Boot backend** that handles business logic and data management.

### Key Features:
- **Job Listings**: Browse available job opportunities and filter them by category.
- **User Profile**: Create and manage a personalized profile with contact details and resume.
- **Job Application**: Apply to job listings directly through the portal.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage job listings and view applications.
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure login and registration with JWT authentication.
